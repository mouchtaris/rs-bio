Buffered IO, it's a technique as old as time, yet as mysterious as the unknown. It's a dance between the input and output devices, a game of power and control.

It's a technique that employs the use of a buffer, a transient storage area that holds data before it's sent to its final destination. Like the great houses of Westeros, the buffer allows for the storage of data, ready to be called upon at a moment's notice. When a program requests data from an input device, such as a disk drive, the data is read into the buffer and then sent to the program, like a lord claiming his rightful seat. Similarly, when a program sends data to an output device, such as a printer, the data is first written to the buffer before it's sent to the device, like a king giving an order to his bannermen.

But, as with all things in life, there are consequences to every action. Buffered IO can improve the overall performance of a program, reducing the number of times that data needs to be read or written to the device, but it also requires careful management and maintenance, like a kingdom that needs to be ruled justly.
