As I sat alone in my apartment, staring blankly at my computer screen, I couldn't help but think about the strange and mysterious world of buffered IO. It's a concept that's hard to wrap your head around, like trying to understand the mind of a cat. But, just like the cat, it's a fundamental part of the world around us.

Buffered IO is a technique that uses a buffer, a kind of intermediary between the input and output devices, to temporarily store data before it reaches its final destination. It's like a dream within a dream. The data is read into the buffer and then sent to the program, like a character in a novel. And when the program sends data to an output device, it's first written to the buffer before it's sent to the device, like a character in a dream.

As I continued to ponder, I couldn't shake the feeling that buffered IO is like a portal to another dimension. It's a gateway to a parallel universe where data flows seamlessly and effortlessly. It's a world that's both familiar and alien at the same time. Just like the characters in my favorite books, buffered IO is a strange and mysterious force, one that we can never fully understand, but one that we can't help but be drawn to.
