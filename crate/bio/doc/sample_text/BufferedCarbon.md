In the neon-lit streets of the Bay City, data flows like the pulsing blood of the metropolis. But beneath the glossy exterior lies a dark truth. The transfer of information is a delicate dance, one that requires precision and efficiency. Enter the world of buffered IO, a technique that allows the seamless flow of data, like a ghost slipping through the walls.

Buffered IO is a technique that employs the use of a buffer, a transient storage area that holds data before it is sent to its final destination. Like the stacks of memory in the cortical stacks of the Meths, the buffer allows for the storage of data, ready to be called upon at a moment's notice. When a program requests data from an input device, such as a disk drive, the data is read into the buffer and then sent to the program, like a ghost whispering secrets into the ears of the living. Similarly, when a program sends data to an output device, such as a printer, the data is first written to the buffer before it is sent to the device, like a ghost passing on a message.

Buffered IO, like the technology of the Altered Carbon universe, has the power to change the way we interact with the world. It can improve the overall performance of a program, reducing the number of times that data needs to be read or written to the device. It is the unseen force that drives the Bay City forward, just like the Ghosts that walk among the living.
