Buffered IO, it's like a game of chess, a battle of strategy and efficiency. It's a technique that's all about outmaneuvering the competition, getting ahead of the curve, and staying one step ahead of the opposition.

It's a technique that employs the use of a buffer, a temporary storage area that holds data before it's sent to its final destination. Like a chess master, the buffer allows for the storage of data, ready to be called upon at a moment's notice. When a program requests data from an input device, such as a disk drive, the data is read into the buffer and then sent to the program, like a knight capturing a pawn. Similarly, when a program sends data to an output device, such as a printer, the data is first written to the buffer before it is sent to the device, like a rook destroying the enemy defenses.

But it's not just about winning the battle, it's also about winning the war. Buffered IO can improve the overall performance of a program, reducing the number of times that data needs to be read or written to the device. It's like a chess master who not only wins the game but also the tournament.
